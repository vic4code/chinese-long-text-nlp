# Chineses Long Text NLP

These techniques enable us to swiftly extract key information from Chinese text and classify similar texts, significantly enhancing the efficiency of our subsidiary in information retrieval and analysis. In the field of natural language processing, handling long texts remains a major challenge for language models, and we have proposed a two-stage model approach to address the difficulties posed by Chinese long texts.
